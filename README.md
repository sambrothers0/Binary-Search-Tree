# Binary Search Tree

This is a **balanced binary search tree** I coded from scratch using Python. Using this structure, numbers can be sorted and stored in **mathematically optimal time**, since the tree automatically detects lopsidedness and **rebalances itself** to maintain the quickest performance.

During the implementation, I:

- Learned about **heaps and trees** as a means of organizing data.
- Discovered the mechanism behind one of **computer science's most important inventions**.

This project deepened my understanding of data structures and the efficiency they bring to algorithms and system performance.

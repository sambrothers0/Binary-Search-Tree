This is a balanced binary search tree I coded from scratch using Python. Using this structure, numbers can be sorted and stored in mathematically optimal time, since the tree automatically detects lopsidedness and rebalances itself to maintain the quickest performance. During the implementation, I learned about heaps and trees as a means of organizing data, and discovered the mechanism behind one of computer science's most important inventions.
